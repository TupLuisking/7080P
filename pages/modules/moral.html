                    Marilou Diaz-Abaya started off her career with a series of feminist films. Her anger towards systematic oppression resulted in her being one of the few filmmakers who actually showed female narratives during the time of Marcos regime. 
                    <br><br>
                    It should be noted that even in the international film scene, it was very rare for a female director to be as prolific as MDA was in the 1980s. 
                    <br><br>
                    After establishing herself as a director for women, she eventually began to cover films that had to do with Philippine history, a subject she had been obsessed with ever since childhood.

                        Inseparability from current events: a lot of the characters’ struggles are inspired by daily life situations during the Martial Law era, such as student activism

                        No big stars were cast (Lorna Tolentino was just starting out), which is also why the film didn’t get much traction <br><br>
                        <span class=darkred>FT</span>: Spot the complex mise-en-scene, meticulous production design, and sensitive camera work - Did this add to the realness of the characters? Did you feel like an observer, or like you were part of the story itself? <br><br>
                        Abaya quote: “While making it, I was already feeling very anxious and uncomfortable about the fact that I thought this is too personal. Baka ako lang ang makakaintindi nito. (I might be the only one to understand it.) I was really hurt when I felt it was rejected. Even if you anticipated that rejection.”

                        Moral went relatively under the radar. It was entered into MMFF but the critics were not used to the format of multiple intersecting storylines.

                        However, it was named the 1984 British Film Institute Outstanding Film of the Year. <span class=darkred>!!</span>:  MDA received this award from London, the city where she last trained to be a filmmaker

                        One of the interesting aspects of local cinema is that Filipinos have never had a problem with empowering female directors and featuring women’s narratives. Joyce Bernal, Malou Santos, Olivia Lamasan, and Cathy Molina-Garcia are some of the other female filmmakers who dominate local cinema today, and many women in the business cite MDA as one of their heroes.
