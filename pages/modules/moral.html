                    Marilou Diaz-Abaya started off her career with a series of feminist lms. Her anger towards systematic oppression resulted in her being one of the few filmmakers who actually showed female narratives during the time of Marcos regime. <br><br>
                    It should be noted that even in the international film scene, it was very rare for a female director to be as prolific as MDA was in the 1980s. <br><br>
                    After establishing herself as a director for women, she eventually began to cover lms that had to do with Philippine history, a subject she had been obsessed with ever since childhood. <br><br>

                        Abaya quote: “While making it, I was already feeling very anxious and uncomfortable about the fact that I thought this is too personal. Baka ako lang ang makakaintindi nito. (I might be the only one to understand it.) I was really hurt when I felt it was rejected. Even if you anticipated that rejection.”

                        Moral went relatively under the radar. Unlike its successor and predecessor, it was entered into MMFF but the critics were not used to the format of multiple intersecting storylines <br><br>
                        However, it has since grown a following of its own, being chosen to be remastered by the ABS-CBN Restoration Project.

Joyce Bernal, Malou Santos, Olivia Lamasan, and Cathy Molina-Garcia are some of the other female filmmakers who dominate local cinema today, and many women in the business cite MDA as one of their heroes.
