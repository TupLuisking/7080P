                <p>His commercial social dramas are charged with thought and introspection resulting in what the National Film Archives of the Philippines calls his trademark “deep-focus realism”.	
                <br><br>	
                He studied film in France and India and was an apprentice of famed director Lamberto Avellana, a legend from the first golden age of Philippine cinema.	
                <br><br>	
                Bernal is probably one of the most philosophical Filipino directors, expertly using simple explorations of everyday life in his character-based multi-narrative process.	
                <br><br>	
                In terms of filmmaking techniques, Bernal is most known for his high production value and extreme attention to detail.
                <br><br>	
                Bernal retired in 1994 due to being disappointed with the local film industry’s supposed deterioration, and instead taught film education in schools and theaters.

                    <p>
                        Inspiration: Ricky Lee wanted to write about ‘faith healers’, as he had learned about multiple incidents of Himala-like happenings in the PH in the 1960s<br><br>
                        Lee’s script was selected for production after winning a contest by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) - Himala became their first film, with Imee Marcos backing it<br><br>
                        It was written with Nora Aunor in mind, which remained unchanged<br><br>
                        There are multiple alternate versions and endings to the script, with one of them seeing Elsa into old age

                    </p>

                        The crew chose to shoot in Ilocos because it was the driest place they could find<br><br>
                        Shooting took 2 months<br><br>
                        Around 3,000 extras were employed for the film; Bernal also asked people who actually had special needs to appear<br><br>
                        <span class="darkred">FT</span>: Bernal’s aim was minimalism on a grand scale, and he purposely asked for acting to be kept subtle and simple so that the viewer could focus on the dialogue (this also adds to the impact of Elsa’s nal speech scene!)

                        The film’s grand scale and big budget were used as its major selling point, especially since the only known actress was Nora Aunor (the rest of the cast were relatively unknown, small stage theater actors)
