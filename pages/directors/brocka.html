                    Extremely prolific (producing up to 6 films in one year), Lino Brocka is probably the most politically-charged Filipino director, taking breaks from lmmaking to literally go out into the street and march, and later on forming the Concerned Artists of the Philippines, a union where directors discuss their social responsibilities to the country as filmmakers.	
                    <br><br>
                    He is famously known for choosing to appease both commercial (his so-called “compromise movies”) and independent (“ambitious movies”) tastes, rmly believing that if any social change were to actually be made, it could only be done through penetrating the masa first.		
                    <br><br>
                    Brocka was the first director to expose the other side of the Marcos’s dream society through lm, getting flack from Imelda Marcos for Maynila sa Kuko ng Liwanag.
                    <br><br>
                    He was also one of the rst few LGBTQ+ directors, and later on was awarded as a National Artist after his death in 1991.
                    <br><br>
                    His biggest goal was to “confront people with [life]”, to initiate a social investigation and understand why national problems came about.

                    Brocka was known for neorealism.<br><br>
                    This genre found its start in 1940s Italian cinema. It is characterized by a definite social context, sense of historical actuality, political commitment to progressive social change, authentic on-location shooting, and documentary style of cinematography.

                    Brocka usually employed actors from his theater troupe and prioritized acting over mise-en-scene (“he knew nothing about lenses”)

            <p class=special> “My job is not to photograph those walls that [Imelda] put up. My job as a director is to nd out why they’re poor. It’s to ask questions. I’m not advocating violence. What I’m saying is that when things don’t change there is only one option for the poor and that is violence. You underestimate the audience. I think they understand what I am trying to say, they respond to it.”</p>
