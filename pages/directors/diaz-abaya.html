                    Marilou Diaz-Abaya started off her career with a series of feminist lms. Her anger towards systematic oppression resulted in her being one of the few filmmakers who actually showed female narratives during the time of Marcos regime. <br><br>
                    It should be noted that even in the international film scene, it was very rare for a female director to be as prolific as MDA was in the 1980s. <br><br>
                    After establishing herself as a director for women, she eventually began to cover lms that had to do with Philippine history, a subject she had been obsessed with ever since childhood. <br><br>

                    Favorite topic: sectoral rights <br><br>
                    The recurring central advocacy in all of MDA’s lms is the struggle that speci c sectors have to face due to the oppressive social structures they were born into, whether it be Filipino women, Muslims in Mindanao, or those engaged in dynamite shing.

                    Filmmaking practice: constant collaboration <br><br>
                    MDA was known for frequently collaborating with the same set of filmmaking superstars from the second golden age of Philippine cinema. She directed 9 lms written by Ricky Lee, was mentored by Ishmael Bernal, and was an active member in Lino Brocka’s Concerned Artists of the Philippines. All of them used lm to express their dissent against Martial Law.

            <p class=special> Brutal (1980), Moral (1982), and Karnal (1983) are a three-part series of films directed by MDA and written by Ricky Lee. All films have different characters yet follow one theme: women who battle against sexist and misogynist structures.</p>
