                <p>His commercial social dramas are charged with thought and introspection resulting in what the National Film Archives of the Philippines calls his trademark “deep-focus realism”.	
                <br><br>	
                He studied film in France and India and was an apprentice of famed director Lamberto Avellana, a legend from the first golden age of Philippine cinema.	
                <br><br>	
                Bernal is probably one of the most philosophical Filipino directors, expertly using simple explorations of everyday life in his character-based multi-narrative process.	
                <br><br>	
                In terms of filmmaking techniques, Bernal is most known for his high production value and extreme attention to detail.
                <br><br>	
                Bernal retired in 1994 due to being disappointed with the local film industry’s supposed deterioration, and instead taught film education in schools and theaters.

                <p>
                    <span class="darkred fontHarbour">!!</span>: Bernal considered himself a feminist director and admitted that it was part of his interest to tackle issues affecting women. A significant part of his work is stories about and for women.

                    Bernal favored simple, minimalist interactions (sometimes putting them on a grand backdrop to further emphasize them). He believed these were more true-to-life, something ideal because he wanted to capture the everyday aspect of his narratives as much as possible.
